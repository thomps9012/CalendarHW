# CalendarHW

A simple daily schedule application that utilizes JavaScript, CSS, and HTML in order to save typed in tasks to local storage. 
The app automatically changes color of the hour based on whether or not the hour has passed (green for current or future hours and red for past hours).Google fonts and Bootstrap styling were also used in the custom styling of the application. jQuery was used in order to populate local storage with the hourly tasks written out.
